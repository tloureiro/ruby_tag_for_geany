detach|Class:Process Description:Some operating systems retain the status of terminated child processesuntil the parent collects that status (normally using some variant ofwait(). If the parent never collects this status, the childstays around as a zombie process. Process::detachprevents this by setting up a separate Ruby thread whose sole job is toreap the status of the process pid when it terminates. Usedetach only when you do not intent to explicitly wait for thechild to terminate.  The waiting thread returns the exit status of the detached process when itterminates, so you can use Thread#join to know the result.  Ifspecified pid is not a valid child process ID, the thread returnsnil immediately.  The waiting thread has pid method which returns the pid.  In this first example, we don't reap the first child process, so it appearsas a zombie in the process status display.  produces:  In the next example, Process::detach is used to reap the childautomatically.

handle_interrupt|Class:Thread Description:Changes asynchronous interrupt timing.  interrupt means asynchronous event and corresponding procedure by#raise, #kill, signal trap (not supported yet)and main thread termination (if main thread terminates, then all otherthread will be killed).  The given hash has pairs like ExceptionClass =&gt;:TimingSymbol. Where the ExceptionClass is the interrupt handled bythe given block. The TimingSymbol can be one of the following symbols:  Invoke interrupts immediately.  Invoke interrupts while BlockingOperation.  Never invoke all interrupts.  BlockingOperation means that the operation will block the callingthread, such as read and write.  On CRuby implementation,BlockingOperation is any operation executed without GVL.  Masked asynchronous interrupts are delayed until they are enabled. Thismethod is similar to sigprocmask(3).  Asynchronous interrupts are difficult to use.  If you need to communicate between threads, please consider to use anotherway such as Queue.  Or use them with deep understanding about this method.  In this example, we can guard from #raise exceptions.  Using the :never TimingSymbol the RuntimeError exception will always be ignoredin the first block of the main thread. In the second ::handle_interrupt blockwe can purposefully handle RuntimeErrorexceptions.  While we are ignoring the RuntimeErrorexception, it's safe to write our resource allocation code. Then, theensure block is where we can safely deallocate your resources.  In the next example, we will guard from the TimeoutError exception. Thiswill help prevent from leaking resources when TimeoutError exceptions occurduring normal ensure clause. For this example we use the help of thestandard library Timeout, from lib/timeout.rb  In the first part of the timeout block, we can rely onTimeoutError being ignored. Then in the TimeoutError =&gt;:on_blocking block, any operation that will block the calling threadis susceptible to a TimeoutError exception being raised.  It's possible to stack multiple levels of ::handle_interrupt blocksin order to control more than one ExceptionClass and TimingSymbol at atime.  All exceptions inherited from the ExceptionClass parameter will beconsidered. -|(hash) { ... }->result of the block|

pipe|Class:IO Description:Creates a pair of pipe endpoints (connected to each other) and returns themas a two-element array of IO objects: [read_io, write_io ].  If a block is given, the block is called and returns the value of theblock. read_io and write_io are sent to the block asarguments. If read_io and write_io are not closed when the block exits,they are closed. i.e. closing read_io and/or write_io doesn't cause anerror.  Not available on all platforms.  If an encoding (encoding name or encoding object) is specified as anoptional argument, read string from pipe is tagged with the encodingspecified. If the argument is a colon separated two encoding names "A:B",the read string is converted from encoding A (external encoding) toencoding B (internal encoding), then tagged with B. If two optionalarguments are specified, those must be encoding objects or encoding names,and the first one is the external encoding, and the second one is theinternal encoding. If the external encoding and the internal encoding isspecified, optional hash argument specify the conversion option.  In the example below, the two processes close the ends of the pipe thatthey are not using. This is not just a cosmetic nicety. The read end of apipe will not generate an end of file condition if there are any writerswith the pipe still open. In the case of the parent process, therd.read will never return if it does not first issue awr.close.  produces: -|()->[read_io, write_io]|

popen|Class:IO Description:Runs the specified command as a subprocess; the subprocess's standard inputand output will be connected to the returned IO object.  The PID of the started process can be obtained by #pid method.  cmd is a string or an array as follows.  If cmd is a String "-", then a newinstance of Ruby is started as the subprocess.  If cmd is an Array of String, then itwill be used as the subprocess's argv bypassing a shell. Thearray can contains a hash at first for environments and a hash at last foroptions similar to spawn.  The default mode for the new file object is "r", but mode may beset to any of the modes listed in the description for class IO. The last argument opt qualifiesmode.  Raises exceptions which IO.pipe and Kernel.spawnraise.  If a block is given, Ruby will run the command as a child connected to Rubywith a pipe. Ruby's end of the pipe will be passed as a parameter to theblock. At the end of block, Ruby close the pipe and sets $?.In this case IO.popen returns the value of the block.  If a block is given with a cmd of "-", the block willbe run in two separate processes: once in the parent, and once in a child.The parent process will be passed the pipe object as a parameter to theblock, the child version of the block will be passed nil, andthe child's standard in and standard out will be connected to the parentthrough the pipe.

const_get|Class:Module Description:Checks for a constant with the given name in mod Ifinherit is set, the lookup will also search the ancestors (andObject if mod is a Module.)  The value of the constant is returned if a definition is found, otherwise aNameError is raised.  This method will recursively look up constant names if a namespaced classname is provided.  For example:  The inherit flag is respected on each lookup.  For example: -|(sym, inherit=true)->obj|
const_missing|Class:Module Description:Invoked when a reference is made to an undefined constant in mod.It is passed a symbol for the undefined constant, and returns a value to beused for that constant. The following code is an example of the same:  In the next example when a reference is made to an undefined constant, itattempts to load a file whose name is the lowercase version of the constant(thus class Fred is assumed to be in filefred.rb).  If found, it returns the loaded class. It thereforeimplements an autoload feature similar to Kernel#autoload and #autoload. -|(sym)->obj|

When you wantto handle these conversion errors, use #primitive_convert. -|(source_string)->destination_string|
convpath|Class:Encoding::Converter Description:Returns the conversion path of ec.  The result is an array of conversions.  Each element of the array is a pair of encodings or a string. A pair meansan encoding conversion. A string means a decorator.

This method is for use in system specific scripts, so if you want across-platform hash function consider using Digest or OpenSSL instead. -|(salt_str)->new_str|
curry|Class:Proc Description:Returns a curried proc. If the optional arity argument is given,it determines the number of arguments. A curried proc receives somearguments.

If a block is specified, it is used asthe method body. This block is evaluated using instance_eval,a point that is tricky to demonstrate because define_method isprivate. (This is why we resort to the send hack in thisexample.)  produces: -|(symbol, method)->new_method|

See also thediscussion under Object#clone. In general, cloneand dup may have different semantics in descendant classes.While clone is used to duplicate an object, including itsinternal state, dup typically uses the class of the descendantobject to create the new instance.  This method may have class-specific behavior.  If so, that behavior will bedocumented under the #initialize_copy method of the class. -|()->an_object|

encode|Class:String Description:The first form returns a copy of str transcoded to encodingencoding. The second form returns a copy of strtranscoded from src_encoding to dst_encoding. The last form returns a copyof str transcoded to Encoding.default_internal.  By default, the first and second form raise Encoding::UndefinedConversionErrorfor characters that are undefined in the destination encoding, and Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceErrorfor invalid byte sequences in the source encoding. The last form by defaultdoes not raise exceptions but uses replacement strings.  The options Hash gives details forconversion and can have the following keys:  If the value is :replace, encode replaces invalid bytesequences in str with the replacement character.  The defaultis to raise the Encoding::InvalidByteSequenceErrorexception  If the value is :replace, encode replaces characters which areundefined in the destination encoding with the replacement character. Thedefault is to raise the Encoding::UndefinedConversionError.  Sets the replacement string to the given value. The default replacementstring is "uFFFD" for Unicode encoding forms, and "?" otherwise.  Sets the replacement string by the given object for undefined character. The object should be a Hash, a Proc, a Method, or an objectwhich has [] method. Its key is an undefined character encoded in thesource encoding of current transcoder. Its value can be any encoding untilit can be converted into the destination encoding of the transcoder.  The value must be :text or :attr. If the value is:text encodereplaces undefined characters with their (upper-case hexadecimal) numericcharacter references. '&amp;', '&lt;', and '&gt;' are converted to"&amp;amp;", "&amp;lt;", and "&amp;gt;", respectively. If the value is:attr, encode alsoquotes the replacement result (using '"'), and replaces '"' with"&amp;quot;".  Replaces LF ("n") with CR ("r") if value is true.  Replaces LF ("n") with CRLF ("rn") if value is true.  Replaces CRLF ("rn") and CR ("r") with LF ("n") if value is true. -|(encoding [, options] )->str|

If ios is a stream such as pipe or socket, IO#eof?blocks until the other end sends some data or closes it.  Note that IO#eof? reads data to the input byte buffer. SoIO#sysread may not behave as you intend withIO#eof?, unless you call IO#rewind first (whichis not available for some streams). -|()->true or false|
eql?|||
obj =|Class:Object Description:Equality - At the Object level, == returnstrue only if obj and other are thesame object. Typically, this method is overridden in descendant classes toprovide class-specific meaning.  Unlike ==, the equal? method should never beoverridden by subclasses as it is used to determine object identity (thatis, a.equal?(b) if and only if a is the sameobject as b):  The eql? method returns true if objand other refer to the same hash key.  This is used by Hash to test members for equality.  For objects ofclass Object, eql? is synonymous with==.  Subclasses normally continue this tradition by aliasingeql? to their overridden == method, but there areexceptions.  Numeric types, for example, perform typeconversion across ==, but not across eql?, so: -|= other->true or false|

format|Class:Kernel Description:Returns the string resulting from applying format_string to anyadditional arguments.  Within the format string, any characters other thanformat sequences are copied to the result.  The syntax of a format sequence is follows.  A format sequence consists of a percent sign, followed by optional flags,width, and precision indicators, then terminated with a field typecharacter.  The field type controls how the correspondingsprintf argument is to be interpreted, while the flags modifythat interpretation.  The field type characters are:  The flags modifies the behavior of the formats. The flag characters are:  Examples of flags:  The field width is an optional integer, followed optionally by a period anda precision.  The width specifies the minimum number of characters thatwill be written to the result for this field.  Examples of width:  For numeric fields, the precision controls the number of decimal placesdisplayed.  For string fields, the precision determines the maximum numberof characters to be copied from the string.  (Thus, the format sequence%10.10s will always contribute exactly ten characters to theresult.)  Examples of precisions:  Examples:  For more complex formatting, Ruby supports a reference by name.%&lt;name&gt;s style uses format style, but %{name} style doesn't.

A Proc object converted from a method has notricks.  define_method is treated the same as method definition. Thedefined method has no tricks.  define_method always defines a method without the tricks, evenif a non-lambda Proc object is given. This is theonly exception for which the tricks are not preserved.  This exception insures that methods never have tricks and makes it easy tohave wrappers to define methods that behave as usual.  The wrapper def2 defines a method which has no tricks. -|()->true or false|

If it is omitted, nil is assumed.  destination_bytesize should be an integer or nil. nil means unlimited. Ifit is omitted, nil is assumed.  opt should be nil, a hash or an integer. nil means no flags. If it isomitted, nil is assumed.  #primitive_convertconverts the content of source_buffer from beginning and store the resultinto destination_buffer.  destination_byteoffset and destination_bytesize specify the region whichthe converted result is stored. destination_byteoffset specifies the startposition in destination_buffer in bytes. If destination_byteoffset is nil,destination_buffer.bytesize is used for appending the result.destination_bytesize specifies maximum number of bytes. Ifdestination_bytesize is nil, destination size is unlimited. Afterconversion, destination_buffer is resized to destination_byteoffset +actually produced number of bytes. Also destination_buffer's encoding isset to destination_encoding.  #primitive_convertdrops the converted part of source_buffer. the dropped part is converted indestination_buffer or buffered in Encoding::Converter object.  #primitive_convertstops conversion when one of following condition met.  invalid byte sequence found in source buffer (:invalid_byte_sequence)primitive_errinfo and last_error methods returnsthe detail of the error.  unexpected end of source buffer (:incomplete_input) this occur only when:partial_input is not specified. primitive_errinfo andlast_error methods returns the detail of the error.  character not representable in output encoding (:undefined_conversion)primitive_errinfo and last_error methods returnsthe detail of the error.  after some output is generated, before input is done (:after_output) thisoccur only when :after_output is specified.  destination buffer is full (:destination_buffer_full) this occur only whendestination_bytesize is non-nil.  source buffer is empty (:source_buffer_empty) this occur only when:partial_input is specified.  conversion is finished (:finished)  example: -|(source_buffer, destination_buffer)->symbol|

For example,a converter from EUC-JP to ISO-8859-1 converts a string as follows: EUC-JP-&gt; UTF-8 -&gt; ISO-8859-1. So [enc1, enc2] is either ["EUC-JP", "UTF-8"]or ["UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1"].  error_bytes and readagain_bytes indicate the byte sequences which causedthe error. error_bytes is discarded portion. readagain_bytes is bufferedportion which is read again on next conversion.

sort|||
sort!|Class:Array Description:Sorts self in place.  Comparisons for the sort will be done using the &lt;=&gt;operator or using an optional code block.  The block must implement a comparison between a andb, and return -1, when a followsb, 0 when a and b areequivalent, or +1 if b follows a.  See also Enumerable#sort_by. -|()->ary|
sort_by|Class:Enumerable Description:Sorts enum using a set of keys generated by mapping the values inenum through the given block.  If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.  The current implementation of sort_by generates an array oftuples containing the original collection element and the mapped value.This makes sort_by fairly expensive when the keysets aresimple.  produces:  However, consider the case where comparing the keys is a non-trivialoperation. The following code sorts some files on modification time usingthe basic sort method.  This sort is inefficient: it generates two new File objectsduring every comparison. A slightly better technique is to use theKernel#test method to generate the modification timesdirectly.  This still generates many unnecessary Time objects. A moreefficient technique is to cache the sort keys (modification times in thiscase) before the sort. Perl users often call this approach a SchwartzianTransform, after Randal Schwartz. We construct a temporary array, whereeach element is an array containing our sort key along with the filename.We sort this array, and then extract the filename from the result.  This is exactly what sort_by does internally. -|->array|
sort_by!|Class:Array Description:Sorts self in place using a set of keys generated by mappingthe values in self through the given block.  If no block is given, an Enumerator isreturned instead. -|->ary|

sprintf|Class:Kernel Description:Returns the string resulting from applying format_string to anyadditional arguments.  Within the format string, any characters other thanformat sequences are copied to the result.  The syntax of a format sequence is follows.  A format sequence consists of a percent sign, followed by optional flags,width, and precision indicators, then terminated with a field typecharacter.  The field type controls how the correspondingsprintf argument is to be interpreted, while the flags modifythat interpretation.  The field type characters are:  The flags modifies the behavior of the formats. The flag characters are:  Examples of flags:  The field width is an optional integer, followed optionally by a period anda precision.  The width specifies the minimum number of characters thatwill be written to the result for this field.  Examples of width:  For numeric fields, the precision controls the number of decimal placesdisplayed.  For string fields, the precision determines the maximum numberof characters to be copied from the string.  (Thus, the format sequence%10.10s will always contribute exactly ten characters to theresult.)  Examples of precisions:  Examples:  For more complex formatting, Ruby supports a reference by name.%&lt;name&gt;s style uses format style, but %{name} style doesn't.  Exapmles: -|(format_string [, arguments...] )->string|
squeeze|Class:String Description:Builds a set of characters from the other_str parameter(s) usingthe procedure described for String#count. Returns a new stringwhere runs of the same character that occur in this set are replaced by asingle character. If no arguments are given, all runs of identicalcharacters are replaced by a single character. -|([other_str]*)->new_str|

stopsig|Class:Process::Status Description:Returns the number of the signal that caused stat to stop (ornil if self is not stopped). -|()->fixnum or nil|
strftime|Class:Time Description:Formats time according to the directives in the given formatstring.  The directives begin with a percent (%) character. Any text not listed as adirective will be passed through to the output string.  The directive consists of a percent (%) character, zero or more flags,optional minimum field width, optional modifier and a conversion specifieras follows:  Flags:  The minimum field width specifies the minimum width.  The modifiers are "E" and "O". They are ignored.  Format directives:  This method is similar to strftime() function defined in ISO C and POSIX.  While all directives are locale independent since Ruby 1.9, %Z is platformdependent. So, the result may differ even if the same format string is usedin other systems such as C.  %z is recommended over %Z. %Z doesn't identify the timezone. For example,"CST" is used at America/Chicago (-06:00), America/Havana (-05:00),Asia/Harbin (+08:00), Australia/Darwin (+09:30) and Australia/Adelaide(+10:30). Also, %Z is highly dependent on the operating system. Forexample, it may generate a non ASCII string on Japanese Windows. i.e. theresult can be different to "JST". So the numeric time zone offset, %z, isrecommended.  Examples:  Various ISO 8601 formats: -|( string )->string|

sysread|Class:IO Description:Reads maxlen bytes from ios using a low-level read andreturns them as a string.  Do not mix with other methods that read fromios or you may get unpredictable results. If the optionaloutbuf argument is present, it must reference a String, which will receive the data. Theoutbuf will contain only the received data after the method calleven if it is not empty at the beginning. RaisesSystemCallError on error and EOFError at end offile. -|(maxlen[, outbuf])->string|

This is to prevent insecure data, such as command-line argumentsor strings read from Kernel#gets,from inadvertently compromising the users system.  To check whether an object is tainted, use tainted?  You should only untaint a tainted object if your code has inspected it anddetermined that it is safe. To do so use untaint  In $SAFE level 3 and 4, all objects are tainted and untrusted, any use oftrust or taint methods will raise a SecurityError exception. -|()->obj|

transfer|Class:Fiber Description:Transfer control to another fiber, resuming it from where it last stoppedor starting it if it was not resumed before. The calling fiber will besuspended much like in a call to Fiber.yield. You need torequire 'fiber' before using this method.  The fiber which receives the transfer call is treats it much like a resumecall. Arguments passed to transfer are treated like those passed to resume.  You cannot resume a fiber that transferred control to another one. Thiswill cause a double resume error. You need to transfer control back to thisfiber before it can yield and resume.  Example: -|(args, ...)->obj|

undef_method|Class:Module Description:Prevents the current class from responding to calls to the named method.Contrast this with remove_method, which deletes the methodfrom the particular class; Ruby will still search superclasses and mixed-inmodules for a possible receiver. String argumentsare converted to symbols.  produces: -|(symbol)->self|
ungetbyte|Class:IO Description:Pushes back bytes (passed as a parameter) onto ios, such that asubsequent buffered read will return it. Only one byte may be pushed backbefore a subsequent read operation (that is, you will be able to read onlythe last of several bytes that have been pushed back). Has no effect withunbuffered reads (such as IO#sysread). -|(string)->nil|

The formatstring consists of a sequence of single-character directives, summarized inthe table at the end of this entry. Each directive may be followed by anumber, indicating the number of times to repeat with this directive. Anasterisk ("*") will use up all remaining elements. Thedirectives sSiIlL may each be followed by an underscore("_") or exclamation mark ("!") to use theunderlying platform's native size for the specified type; otherwise, ituses a platform-independent consistent size. Spaces are ignored in theformat string. See also Array#pack.  This table summarizes the various formats and the Ruby classes returned byeach. -|(format)->anArray|

write_nonblock|Class:IO Description:Writes the given string to ios using the write(2) system callafter O_NONBLOCK is set for the underlying file descriptor.  It returns the number of bytes written.  #write_nonblock just callsthe write(2) system call. It causes all errors the write(2) system callcauses: Errno::EWOULDBLOCK, Errno::EINTR, etc. The result may also besmaller than string.length (partial write). The caller should care sucherrors and partial write.  If the exception is Errno::EWOULDBLOCK or Errno::AGAIN, it is extended byIO::WaitWritable. So IO::WaitWritable can be used to rescue theexceptions for retrying write_nonblock.  If the write buffer is not empty, it is flushed at first.  When #write_nonblock raisesan exception kind of IO::WaitWritable,#write_nonblock should not becalled until io is writable for avoiding busy loop. This can be done asfollows.  Note that this doesn't guarantee to write all data in string. The lengthwritten is reported as result and it should be checked later.  On some platforms such as Windows, #write_nonblock is not supportedaccording to the kind of the IO object. In suchcases, #write_nonblock raisesErrno::EBADF. -|(string)->integer|
